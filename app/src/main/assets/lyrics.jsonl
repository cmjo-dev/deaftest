Half of each verse is taken from Mississippi Fred McDowell's \"Fred's Worried Life Blues.\" The rest is our own concoction.

Bang! Bang! Vamanos! Vamanos!\" has nothing to do with guns. It got its start long ago when Tim, and I can't recall why, said, \"Vamanos! Bang! Bang!\" Add a bit of John Lee Hooker and there you go. The ripping harp solo is none other that Five Horse Johnson's Eric Oblander.\"\n\nWell you made me weep and you made me moan\nWhen you caused me to leave, child, my happy home.\nBut someday, baby, you ain't gonna worry my life anymore.\nI get satisfaction everywhere I go.\nWhere I lay my head - that's where I call home.\nWhether barren pines, or the mission stare,\nTake tomorrow's collar and give 'em back the glare.\nBang, bang, bang, bang!

clarity\nApparently it all has to do with\nPopularity there will be obstacles\nPrimarily people blind into what is\nCarefully being prepared for me\nSometimes we'll have 11e paid for the in\nProsperity I'm asking Hillary Clinton to\nMarry me too powerful in the very least\nGiving you all of my money but never see\nLegacy every day than I meant to see\nEveryone here is impaired so

thing these\nFamous when they don't understand that I\nTake race and I make his from basic\nPlaylist to the greatest than the team\nIn the nation be patient was waiting for\nMe to break in re-energize the lyrics to\nMemorize start an enterprise a better\nGuide so can I be successful and never\nTry that's my dream job being lazy just\nSitting with the TV on they say that I'm\nRight like me on ba I ain't taking\nResponsibility pay me for having\nWith little humidity but whatever I'm\nDoing it seems to be killing me I'm a\nWillingly artistically fitting into this\nHistory trying to show you one better\nBut none of you believe me trying to win\nThis go and try hard good game GG you\nBeat me and now you see me in 3d but you\nCan't feel me showing up on your device\nControl option D Lee consider me part of\nHeatley measure myself from retweets\nI'll be talking away more chill so you\nCan reach me instead of pretending you\nUnderstand what I'm talking about I'm\nSipping you kind of scared for like a\nHaunted house trying to show you\nSomething instead of just sitting on the\nCouch I'll be honest now I rarely end up\nWalking now into reality getting allowed\nTo be actually a high belief by myself\nDoing nothing you don't laugh at me why\nCuz ideally you would do the same thing\nNothing cos for a brain that is amazing\nIt's now complaining but the best part\nOf life is not even living it love\nSleeping and just using it and never\nMuch time is limited and I better figure\nThis perform slipping this opportunity\nOn my fingertips now let me just tell\nYou what I came to do trying to show you\nWhy can rap as fast as I'm able to\nTrying to show you why can hop in here\nLike a kangaroo and say some stupid\nMetaphors and leave out there I'm\nBreaking through and if a major record\nLabel is looking at me I'm a nice guy\nWith bad teeth got a nice ID for bad\nBeats I can't use ride fast their raps\nSlow I may make mistakes but everyone\nHas so I'm like MJ back when he had the\nAfro oh so I'm not black so maybe not\nBut before everyone gets angry stop I'm\nThat person they're people naturally\nHeymy blood all the people who keep on\nGoing crazy off because I won't be\nMaking amazing songs in a mainstream car\nA lot of prominent features I'm a\nConfident speaker with some dominant\nTeachers I deserve to be a starter but\nConstantly on the bleachers I'm awfully\nSmaller cheaper when I'm up on a spot\nAnd eager baby fearing this every time\nThat they hear and it don't know that my\nLyrics had a precision of building a\nPyramid so when you live in this please\nLet me know when I'm standing here\nFrozen please let it go hit metronome\n\nCombine the compilation to unlock\nSuperstardom and move all across the\nNation but that it's just a dream and\nProbably a combination of a big ego and\nFalse encouragement on the way in but\nWhen I'm playing it just know it's all a\nBig game I'm just trying to blow up and\nHave a big name but when you think about\nIt it is all insane working be created\nFrom chemicals in this brain but when\nYou look at me a lack of respect when\nI'm cracking my neck so that I can rap\nTo my chest cousin of bread some say\nThat it's magic I step until I'm on the\nSame stage that you have it again but so\nWhen you think about the Hall of Fame\nYou think about a people used to sit and\nCall your name and you check and wonder\nIf it will be artists a step back into\nReality it all remains damn alright I\nJust spilled water on my computer right\nNow on my computers breaking while I'm\nDoing this thirty thousand words shit\nGoddamn it\nMy lyrics are not showing up on a swing\nYou know when\nWhat I mean this is off the top I don't\nNeed to use no machines hold up I know I\nCan freestyle but I can't do it forever\nBut I am very clever okay\nOkay I'm gonna take a drink if you're\nWatching this take a drink - these are\nSome shit that you can drink - but drink\nWater unless you're of age you know what\nI'm saying hey okay okay hey I feel like\nI'm Way too different ridiculous most of\nHumanity's made of idiots I barely even\nGet myself and you thinking you\nUnderstand you think I to be highly\nScreen gives you the upper hand please\nWhat I do is barely poetry this hope for\nMe I'm noticing people starting to\nNotice me but still consider me\nConfidence then consider me ready and\nGiving out all my flawlessness bye\nHonestly all of this is haunting me\nProbably it is just a sense of myself\nWobble and toppling into awfully small\nPieces normally all leaving is tragic\nAnd knobs leading it follows me all\nEvening it's calling my name it\nConstantly makes it so hard to stay away\nI close my eyes I let it go and it all\nFades away yeah we're just trying to\nFind a great escape to get away from how\nWe live in life day to day some people\nFight it in a drink or in a cup or in\nSome bling or branded drug or any things\nThat give us love but all I know is that\nIt's tough and all I know is that the\nStuff isn't enough is way too much I'm\nShowing you like this dictator man what\nI gotta do to make this quick paper\nThese kid haters are like 10 years open\nStill claim to be big players that shit\nWill make me go but I'm aiming\nUm and lo got amazing bronze in a crazy\nFlow when I may be live but I came to\nShow what I can do when I get on a mic\nAnd I'm keeping it moving you sit in the\nHype and I'm seeing it the one success\nInside I don't take it for granted but\nBlood to this life selling a romper\nGetting a right like 2:00 a.m. in my\nHead in the lake head of the bedroom I'm\nLiving the rest of my golf the bedding\nAnd I get in there like I'll be living\nIn first class\nI know the chena but will surpass gonna\nKnow worst half for this burn trash\nWhenever I work fast\nRemember the members they sent in and\nSaid and again and again and they never\nWill ended si de splendor but never but\nLegend and every cent as I say is\nPerfected take a deep breath cuz I need\nThat most y'all don't even care what I'm\nSaying you really just like our speed\nFast my bars are met I got metal bars\nWith meta eights and metaphors you want\nBetter chords and better cars but you\nDon't know what I'm heading towards say\nThat I am the king of the shit crazy\nBronze ain't thinking today some singing\nAnd rapping and making it happen and\nMake you laugh while I'm bringing it\nShit trying to find the other way but\nY'all just waiting for another day cuz\nWhat other 14 year old I hit a 100k I'm\nMaking the most of a crazier flow so\nMany ways I can go

how I'm gonna make again a famous\nMan attains a certain you keep it\nStandards low I keep my standards high I\nWanna get on in the action like the\nPrizes camera guy can't and I'm fucking\nInsane sometimes I fantasize when it\nWould be like to be normal if I this\nRandomized and analyze my situations\nLeaving people paralyzed and take a step\nOut of bed hit me while I'm in my\nParadise America's very nice but I like\nTo see the world but I like to get out\nInto the open and meet my girl and a\nMercedes Benz with this lady friends\nCrazy Ben is just chilling with them\nWith me you know they'd be tense they'd\nBe tense or more they'd be tense or more\nI like to talk to all these people cuz\nThey marvel at my metaphors it's free\nSpeech I can say what I want\nBut these listening

right\nTime fuck that\nI'ma live for the moment sitting here in\nThe middle by the night time my mind\nPuzzle with the thoughts that be flowing\nDown I've been living in a headache\nBitches never listening it saying that\nThey ready but I can never believe them\nGot these girls and they can never\nAchieve them how can your dreams come\nTrue if you ain't one\nDamn that's a lot of shit to take about\nSuddenly company starts to come to me\nWonder bring what I'm doing my next I\nFeel it like that shit I gotta pick a\nRoute Mason Pitts I gotta get him out\nCut his dreams hell I'm living now in my\nMind's eye given out lots of songs with\nResponses that I never pictured Wow damn\nDamn\nThis beast way too holy to rap over\nMental block my minds capacities that's\nLove with your raps lower they lack\nCloser they lack substance like a\nPrinter without Tony y'all filling pages\nThat have nothing oh but I have got\nSomething to tell you I ain't got some\nMoney or bullshit to sell you speaking\nFrom late nights I'm thinking the\nDrake's like watching these inner who's\nThinking one day I might be on that\nStage right beside all these players\nShit's up to me I won't hide it in\nPrayers I'll prove it in the music I\nUsed to influence I do this to wait\nHarder than people assuming resume in my\nWriting if you win this lighting that\nPuts me to be in the view of the height\nAnd I do what they like and but that\nMakes them hate me no matter what I do\nThey just mistake the reason I'm flowing\nThe reason I start up not just for the\nFame and the money this dumb person\nDamn I talking about the carpet place\nMost to these rappers only bright this\nShit using copy/paste I'd have made a\nLot of songs that go to waste I just\nNeed a homerun I already loaded bass is\nI have got so many cases been visiting\nLive in in so many places experiences\nThat I made me\n- Emmy then be and please I hope you let\nMe be me I ain't greedy or needy believe\nMe I just want to be on your TV get on\nMy level cuz I need a new staircase down\nYeah I've been looking at this face then\nOne day I'll be there I know what I'm\nDoing when I'm already prepared I've\nBeen waiting like Dirty Dozen tears\nTrying to make the world listen so make\nSure that you can hear I'm trying to\nTake a passion out of turning my career\nI'm concerned without my fear but I'm\nHurting and I'm here now earned it and\nI'm here to stay I'm coming in you're\nTrying to clear the way another chance\nAnother fucking here to play not even\n1718 I'm so near to fame not really look\nAt all the shit I just here to stay look\nAt the future nostalgically I cure every\nDisease and y'all still wouldn't be\nProud of me and doubtedly know how to be\nWhat I am about to be to say that money\nTalks and that shit seems so damn loud\nTo me recently I have been feeling\nAlienated my songs out of this world\nPeople claim that aliens made I'm a baby\nI'm crazy don't hate me don't hate me\nCuz I'm different but hate me because\nYou hate me then maybe we can live with\nThat people say that this is the biggest\nThing to hop on the screen all will\nScream overreacting like it's a trauma\nScene y'all are meanest is the best\nQuality is honesty promise me that it's\nThe reality where's Keanu Reeves trapped\nIn a matrix it's how I felt some time\nBack in their ages and I rap on a stage\nDoes it now elapsed those days are now\nMoving on move on why you lose the song\nLook for long nothing to see here except\nSome stupid pause boo boo Kabam is whole\nPlace up with one great lung one great\nSong\nThat one great one on vacation I vacate\nTo a location far away from where people\nJust may run a light to go to where\nThere is no one no one no fun osa I'm\nTrying to be me and so young I can\nMurder this beat with no gun go one I've\nToo many problems to handle here\nHold one I just wander the rat boat but\nThat ship has no sons and our puns can\nMake loud junk\nUptown funk was a great song catchy at\nFirst but the radio station playing and\nMaking it just get to the boys my head's\nGonna burst if I hear it again and I'm\nSure I'll stall my speakers on the\nGround denting the earth and now I'm\nAdding this verse and I mean it now that\nAin't gotta span just keeps on bleeding\nYeah good rappers never get to see the\nLight of day but when you sell it sexing\nAnd gimmick the sign in right away\nI'll obey now whatever man what is this\nI'm read as a fence and a mess and I\nPlaying my trike so that people will\nKnow I'm a business nobody witness\nAnything better than when I

about mother fucking the Time and Prince\n(What you talking about?)\nWe talking about funk session 96 style\n96 funk mean a different thing\nThat means you looked at my woman, and I'm stepping to

you\nAnd sing the ripper, we just say oh well\nAnd the white man keeps on building more jails\nI know the system ain't nothing to fool with\nCause you locked up all my homies that I went to school with\nAnd I know damn well you got my name on the list\nCause I'm the one that called your daughter a bitch\nJust a black man doin good, you wanna do me\nBefore you ban rap you need to ban them violent movies\nGangsta rap causes crime, Mike Tyson wrecked the system\nLarry Hoover ran a gang in Illinios can't forget\nMalcom X taught us knowledge, Martin Luther preached for peace\nAnd every day black men lying dead in the street\nSo where's the real education, in the hood\nPeace to the muslims cause they're doing real good\nThey're never giving up, on the black folks\nWe need to buy our own land and try to stack dough\nGet rich if you want to, I ain't trying to front you\nIf Robert Gold want some funk tell him come through\nIt's been a long night but we're still getting funky\nWho opened up the cage and let out the monkey\nI heard it when she said it, \"You just a dogg Short\nlike them G's out in South Side Chicago\"\nI said that's right hoe, I'm from the East O\nAnd I will never spend my money on a six-fo\nHigh performance, is what I'm riding\nI got the game from Oakland so I never stop siding\nI'm getting money in this criminal's country\nHoe's show me love because my pimping's so lovely\nI'm not a role model, unless you trying to mack her\nCause first I am player and second I'm a rapper\nThird I'm just a big ass baller\nTop notch on my beeper but I still won't call her\nCause I got one with me, And I'm a pimp till I die\nDon't be talking to them snitches, you'll get sent on a lie\nDoing time in the pen for some backstabbing\nI wonder what would happen if they catch em\nYou burn his balls with a big lighter, get the gasoline\nAnd he'll be smoking like a mother fucking dope fiend\nNowaday's they like to kill your whole crew\nFor coming to the party and stepping on a shoe\nHe said excuse me, but it wasn't al-right\nSo now you want to take his punk ass outside\nSo you can hit him, and with him\nLet his momma bury him in a suit that don't fit 'em\nYou don't give an F-U-C-K\nSo just fuck him\nDidn't have to shoot him, just walked out and stuck him\nKnife up and down all around in his gut\nStanding in his blood looked down and said \"What's

That won't be done\nI stand protected by the laws of fun\nI am perfected to the rhymes I've run\nWalk it this way and leave the party stunned\nThis music, it launched me with no aim\nI've landed on some plane\nWhere I am I can't explain\nOr never know but it's beautiful, so...\n\nYou can't take this away from me\nAll the way I hit the melody\nThe waves bring clarity\nRunning through me (Come on y'all)\n\nYou can't take this away from me\nAll the way I hit the melody\nThe waves bring clarity\nRunning through me\n"}
